The primary goal was to develop a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate text messages. 

The project began with comprehensive preprocessing of the SMS dataset. This involved tokenization to break down text messages into individual words, removal of stop words to eliminate common, non-informative terms. 

With the dataset prepared, we proceeded to train the Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance accurately. 

Upon completion of training, the model achieving an accuracy of 95% on the training dataset and 70% on the testing dataset.
